		<h1>About our pizzas</h1>
		<p>Trendy pizza toppings come and go, but few topping combinations are so everlasting that they become iconic pizzas in their own right. These are the pizzas you see at every pizza joint and on every delivery menu, and the pizzas we believe every home cook should be able to replicate at home. These are the five most iconic pizzas of all time! </p><br>
		<p>
			Margherita is the mother of all pizzas. This Neopaltian-style pizza has thin crust, fresh tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella cheese, and just a few leaves of basil. Margherita’s toppings are simple but they also have the power to be truly sublime in a way few other toppings can be.

			We’d wager that pepperoni is still America’s number-one, most-popular pizza topping. This singular topping even graces the pizza emoji! It makes sense if you really consider everything that is good about pepperoni: The salty and slightly spicy taste holds its own against waves of melty, gooey cheese and gets ever-so-slightly crisped in the hot oven in such a crave-worthy way that no one can resist pulling them straight from the smoldering hot pizza and dropping them directly into their mouths.
